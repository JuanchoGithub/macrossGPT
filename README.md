# macrossGPT
Attempt to make a Macross NES game but using OpenAI services only

All the code generated by GPT, some changes done by me, mostly tweaking variable values to improve movement, etc.

the IMG folder contains sprites taken out of DALLE2
the SPRITES folder contains sprites generated by the scripts on TEXTURE_GENERATORS
  All those generators were created by GPT, too.
